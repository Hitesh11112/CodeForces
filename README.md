  # 🚀 Codeforces Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome to my Codeforces problem-solving repository!  
This is where I track my competitive programming practice using **C++**.

## 📚 What I’m Following

- 🔗 [Priyansh’s CP Sheet](https://www.tle-eliminators.com/cp-sheet) – A structured roadmap of handpicked problems.
- ❓ Randomly selected problems – To strengthen problem-solving adaptability.
- 🎯 Focus: Consistency, speed, and problem pattern recognition.

## 🛠️ Language Used

- **C++** (Standard: C++17 or above)
  - Using STL extensively (e.g., `vector`, `map`, `set`, `priority_queue`, etc.)
  - Fast I/O and clean template code for contests
